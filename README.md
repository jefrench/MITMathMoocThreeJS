# MITMathMoocThreeJS

three js images created for 18.02.1, 18.02.2 and 18.02.3

(Note that 18.02.3 is currently a shell with some minimal examples for convenience.)

Work to do:

 1. 18.02.1 ensure that all html files have the automatic rotation (except AXES, that is supposed to be static.), ensure they all have the overlay that says "click to interact"
 2. 18.02.2 same overlay + ensure that they link to threejs and jquery (or newer smaller package J-M recommended) rather than old versions in static directory
 
 Note that all of these directories include aliases that allow the html files to work when you click on them natively. They are necessary because of how edX/MITx Online static directory flattens the links when the are imported to studio. At some point, this will have to be fixed once the static directory is able to maintain its structure.
